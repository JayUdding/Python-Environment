SETTING UP THE environment for running Python code.

I took these steps:

INSTALLING PYTHON

I DID DOWNLOAD THE PYTHON language on my computer.
I DID Visit python.org and I DID download the latest stable Python release for THE COMPUTER'S operating system (IN MY CASE macOS).
I DID Check the installation.

USING TERMINAL:

Open the terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and type:

sh
python --version
or, if that doesn't work, try:
sh
python3 --version
You should see a version number printed (e.g., Python 3.12.1).


THIS WORKED--I SEE PYTHON VERSION 3.14.0

SO WE DID SUCCESSFULLY DOWNLOAD PYTHON.

[NOTE: I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE NOTE ABOUT ROOT CERTIFICATES. WE LEAVE THIS FOR ANOTHER DAY]

ADDING THE CODE EDITOR...


Set up a code editor

Install a code editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code), PyCharm, or you can use simple editors like Notepad++.
If using VS Code, install the Python extension for features like syntax highlighting and code suggestions.
Create a virtual environment (Recommended) This keeps your project dependencies isolated:

sh
python -m venv venv
or

sh
python3 -m venv venv
Activate it with:
Windows:
sh
venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:
sh
source venv/bin/activate

You should now see (venv) in your terminal prompt. YES THIS DID WORK


Install packages

While in your activated virtual environment, you can add libraries using pip:
sh
pip install package_name
Example:
sh
pip install requests
Write and run your code

Save your Python code in a .py file.
Execute your scripts by running:
sh
python your_file.py
or
sh
python3 your_file.py
Summary Checklist:

 Download and install Python
 Install a code editor (VS Code is easy)
 (Optional, but recommended) Set up a virtual environment for your project
 Install any additional packages you need
 Write and run .py files via your terminal
