SETTING UP THE environment for running Python code.

I took these steps:

INSTALLING PYTHON

I DID DOWNLOAD THE PYTHON language on my computer.
I DID Visit python.org and I DID download the latest stable Python release for THE COMPUTER'S operating system (IN MY CASE macOS).
I DID Check the installation.

USING TERMINAL:

Open the terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and type:

sh
python --version
or, if that doesn't work (DID NOT WORK), try:
sh
python3 --version
You should see a version number printed (e.g., Python 3.12.1).


THIS WORKED--I AM USING PYTHON VERSION 3.14.0

SO WE DID SUCCESSFULLY DOWNLOAD PYTHON.

[NOTE: I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE NOTE ABOUT ROOT CERTIFICATES. WE LEAVE THIS FOR ANOTHER DAY]

ADDING THE CODE EDITOR...


Set up a code editor

INSTALLED PYCHARM AND PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE BIT 

GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH GITHUB AND PYTHON VIA PYCHARM
