To set up your environment for running Python code as a beginner, follow these simple steps:

Install Python--TODAY WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS

I DID DOWNLOAD IT AND MADE SEVERAL SCREENSHOTS OF THE PROCESS.

[INSERT THE SCREENSHOTS? CAN THIS BE DONE IN THIS FILE??]

I DID Visit python.org and I DID download the latest stable Python release for THE COMPUTER'S operating system (IN MY CASE macOS).

Check the installation--OK THIS IS THE NEXT STEP

Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and type:
sh
python --version
or, if that doesn't work, try:
sh
python3 --version
You should see a version number printed (e.g., Python 3.12.1).


THIS WORKED--I SEE PYTHON VERSION 3.14.0

COULD IT BE THAT I SUCCESSFULLY DOWNLOADED PYTHON?

I DID NOT UNDERSTAND ALL THIS BUSINESS ABOUT ROOT CERTIFICATES. WE LEAVE THIS FOR ANOTHER DAY.

TOMORROW WE WILL ADD THE CODE EDITOR


Set up a code editor

Install a code editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code), PyCharm, or you can use simple editors like Notepad++.
If using VS Code, install the Python extension for features like syntax highlighting and code suggestions.
Create a virtual environment (Recommended) This keeps your project dependencies isolated:

sh
python -m venv venv
or

sh
python3 -m venv venv
Activate it with:
Windows:
sh
venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:
sh
source venv/bin/activate
You should now see (venv) in your terminal prompt.
Install packages

While in your activated virtual environment, you can add libraries using pip:
sh
pip install package_name
Example:
sh
pip install requests
Write and run your code

Save your Python code in a .py file.
Execute your scripts by running:
sh
python your_file.py
or
sh
python3 your_file.py
Summary Checklist:

 Download and install Python
 Install a code editor (VS Code is easy)
 (Optional, but recommended) Set up a virtual environment for your project
 Install any additional packages you need
 Write and run .py files via your terminal
