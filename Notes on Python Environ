SETTING UP THE environment for running Python code.

I took these steps:

INSTALLING PYTHON

I DID DOWNLOAD THE PYTHON language on my computer.
I DID Visit python.org and I DID download the latest stable Python release for THE COMPUTER'S operating system (IN MY CASE macOS).
I DID Check the installation.

USING TERMINAL:

Open the terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and type:

sh
python --version
or, if that doesn't work (DID NOT WORK), try:
sh
python3 --version
You should see a version number printed (e.g., Python 3.12.1).


THIS WORKED--I AM USING PYTHON VERSION 3.14.0

SO WE DID SUCCESSFULLY DOWNLOAD PYTHON.

[NOTE: I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE NOTE ABOUT ROOT CERTIFICATES. WE LEAVE THIS FOR ANOTHER DAY]

INSTALLED PYCHARM AND PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A LITTLE BIT 

GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH GITHUB AND PYTHON VIA PYCHARM




some general insights about using the terminal alongside PyCharm for Python and AI development:

Benefits of Using the Terminal for Python & AI Development:
1. Direct Environment Control

Full control over Python virtual environments and package management
Better understanding of what's happening under the hood vs. IDE abstractions
Easier to replicate your setup across different machines
2. AI/ML Specific Advantages

Running training scripts with precise control over resources and parameters
Monitoring GPU/CPU usage in real-time with tools like nvidia-smi or htop
Better handling of long-running processes without IDE overhead
Easier experimentation with command-line arguments and configurations
3. Flexibility & Debugging

Interactive Python shell (REPL) with python or ipython for quick testing
Running scripts with different Python interpreters easily
Better visibility into errors and warnings without IDE filtering
Easier to use debugging tools like pdb (Python debugger)
4. Reproducibility & DevOps

Learning shell scripting helps with automation
Better preparation for production environments (servers typically use CLI)
Easier to share reproducible commands with teammates
Understanding containerization (Docker) and CI/CD pipelines
5. Complementary to PyCharm

PyCharm excels at code navigation, refactoring, and debugging within projects
Terminal excels at environment management, testing, and data exploration
Use both for optimal workflow: develop in PyCharm, run/debug in terminal
My Recommendation: Keep using PyCharm for development but become comfortable in the terminal for running scripts, managing environments, and AI/ML tasks. They complement each other well!
