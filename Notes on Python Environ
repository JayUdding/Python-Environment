To set up your environment for running Python code as a beginner, follow these simple steps:

Install Python

Visit python.org and download the latest stable Python release for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
On Windows, make sure to select “Add Python to PATH” before clicking Install.
Check the installation

Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and type:
sh
python --version
or, if that doesn't work, try:
sh
python3 --version
You should see a version number printed (e.g., Python 3.12.1).
Set up a code editor

Install a code editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code), PyCharm, or you can use simple editors like Notepad++.
If using VS Code, install the Python extension for features like syntax highlighting and code suggestions.
Create a virtual environment (Recommended) This keeps your project dependencies isolated:

sh
python -m venv venv
or

sh
python3 -m venv venv
Activate it with:
Windows:
sh
venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:
sh
source venv/bin/activate
You should now see (venv) in your terminal prompt.
Install packages

While in your activated virtual environment, you can add libraries using pip:
sh
pip install package_name
Example:
sh
pip install requests
Write and run your code

Save your Python code in a .py file.
Execute your scripts by running:
sh
python your_file.py
or
sh
python3 your_file.py
Summary Checklist:

 Download and install Python
 Install a code editor (VS Code is easy)
 (Optional, but recommended) Set up a virtual environment for your project
 Install any additional packages you need
 Write and run .py files via your terminal
