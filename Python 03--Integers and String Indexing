int = integer -- data type that consists of whole numbers (no decimals, no fractions, no alphabetical characters)
(whereas a string is text placed within quotes--the quotes designate a string)

Strings are an incredibly useful component of python programming. 
We can use strings to store all kinds of information within our programs. 
Peoples’ names, street addresses, paragraphs of text, ID numbers, and more. 
Strings have many built-in features that allow us do do things such as:
extract sub-components, extract individual letters, capitalize words, etc.

NOTE that we cannot concetanate a string + an int (not supported in Python)
We need to CONVERT

E.g.: 

print('He is ' +str(age) + ' years old and is ' + str(height) + ' inches tall')


If we want to calculate we need to ensure that input is in int form--add: int()

E.g.:

revenue = int(input('Business revenue: '))
cost = int(input('Business costs: '))
profit = revenue - cost
print('The business profit is: ' + str(profit))

Here is how to do Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division

When dealing with strings, we can refer to any letter / character within a string by its index. 
An index is just a number that specified what position a character is at within the string.


STRING INDEXING is done with brackets []
Positive--starts with 0
Negative--starts with -1
len = length function

Here we are going to insert a few images:










Example: positive and negative

city = 'Amsterdam'
letter = city[5]
print(letter)

city = 'Amsterdam'
letter = city[-5]
print(letter)

[different letters are the result here]

Example: build a new string via indexing

city = 'Jerusalem.'
rock = city[0] + city[1] + city[8]
print(rock)

Example: here we do not know how long the string is

text = input('Type something: ')
print('The last two characters of your input were: ' + text[-2] + text[-1])


text = input('Type something: ')
last = text[len(text) - 1]
other = text[len(text) - 2]
print('The last two characters of your input were: ' + other + last)
