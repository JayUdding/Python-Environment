int = integer -- data type that consists of whole numbers (no decimals, no fractions, no alphabetical characters)
(whereas a string is text placed within quotes--the quotes designate a string)

float = a number with decimals

Strings are an incredibly useful component of python programming. 
We can use strings to store all kinds of information within our programs. 
Peoples’ names, street addresses, paragraphs of text, ID numbers, and more. 
Strings have many built-in features that allow us do do things such as:
extract sub-components, extract individual letters, capitalize words, etc.

NOTE that we cannot concetanate a string + an int (not supported in Python)
We need to CONVERT

E.g.: 

print('He is ' +str(age) + ' years old and is ' + str(height) + ' inches tall')


If we want to calculate we need to ensure that input is in int form--add: int()

E.g.:

revenue = int(input('Business revenue: '))
cost = int(input('Business costs: '))
profit = revenue - cost
print('The business profit is: ' + str(profit))

Here is how to do Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division

+
-
*
\

A + B adds two numbers together
A - B subtracts the value B from A
A / B divides A by the value B
A * B multiplies A by b
A ** B raises A to the Bth power
A % B gives the remainder of the operation of dividing A by B

Technically, in python, multiplication and division are “tied” in PEMDAS, and so are addition and subtraction. You can use this slightly modifier ordering:

(1) Parentheses
(2) Exponents next
(3) Multiplication, Division, and Modulus (%) are tied
(4) Addition and Subtraction are tied at the bottom

PEMDAS stands for “Parentheses, Exponent, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.”

In python, when you divide an integer by another integer, python actually gives you back a float instead. 
Also, for most math operations, if you mix types (a float on one side, an int on the other) the results will be a float

When dealing with strings, we can refer to any letter / character within a string by its index. 
An index is just a number that specified what position a character is at within the string.


STRING INDEXING is done with brackets []
Positive--starts with 0
Negative--starts with -1
len = length function

Here we are going to insert a few images:



[that did not quite work, but the way to drag and drop a file, in this case screenshots,
works well in issues, so if you go there in this repo, you will see some images...






Example: positive and negative

city = 'Amsterdam'
letter = city[5]
print(letter)

city = 'Amsterdam'
letter = city[-5]
print(letter)

[different letters are the result here]

Example: build a new string via indexing

city = 'Jerusalem.'
rock = city[0] + city[1] + city[8]
print(rock)

Example: here we do not know how long the string is

text = input('Type something: ')
print('The last two characters of your input were: ' + text[-2] + text[-1])


text = input('Type something: ')
last = text[len(text) - 1]
other = text[len(text) - 2]
print('The last two characters of your input were: ' + other + last)
