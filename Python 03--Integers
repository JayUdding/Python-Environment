int = integer -- data type that consists of whole numbers (no decimals, no fractions, no alphabetical characters)
(whereas a string is text placed within quotes--the quotes designate a string)

NOTE that we cannot concetanate a string + an int (not supported in Python)
We need to CONVERT

E.g.: 

print('He is ' +str(age) + ' years old and is ' + str(height) + ' inches tall')


If we want to calculate we ensure that input is in int form--add: int()

E.g.:

revenue = int(input('Business revenue: '))
cost = int(input('Business costs: '))
profit = revenue - cost
print('The business profit is: ' + str(profit))
