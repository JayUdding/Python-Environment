print("the")
print('big')
print("black")
print('box')

This results as follows:

the
big
black
box

\n means a new line is added immmediatly afterwards:

print("the\nbig\nblack\nbox")

Has the same result as above

the
big
black
box

print('the
big
black
box')

This results in a syntax error--meaning the proper syntax was not formed in the code

Could be fixed by using triple quotes:

print('''the
big
black
box''')

This has the earlier result again spanning 4 lines

Quotes can be single ' or double " --seems to make no difference.

+ sign results in concatenation --the combining of two strings

print('one' + 'twenty' + 'one') 

results in 

onetwentyone

, comma creates a space

value_1 = 'bear'
value_2 = 'cheetah'
print(value_1, value_2)
print(value_1 + value_2)

results in

bear cheetah
bearcheetah

Note that we are not printing a string here with commas!
