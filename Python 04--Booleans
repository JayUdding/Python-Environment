Booleans -- is something True or False
Booleans are commonly used for conditions such as if-statements in code

the_sky_is_blue = True
food_is_bad = False
print(the_sky_is_blue, food_is_bad)

This results in:

True False

Some operators:

A < B results in True if A is less than B, False otherwise.
A <= B results in True if A is less than or equal to B, False otherwise.
A > B results in True if A is greater than B, False otherwise.
A >= B results in True if A is greater than or equal to B, False otherwise.
A == B results in True if A is equal to B, False otherwise.
A != B results in True if A is not equal to B, False otherwise.

Example:

home_cost = int(input('How much does the home cost? '))
available_funds = int(input('How much money do you have immediately available? '))
down_payment = home_cost * 0.2
if available_funds >= down_payment:
    print('You can afford the down payment!')
