More learning today -- Variables and Concatenation (combining two or more strings)

print('one' + 'twenty' + 'one') this concatenates into onetwentyone and concatenation works with spaces

value_1 = 'bear'
value_2 = 'cheetah'
print(value_1, value_2)
print(value_1 + value_2)

result:

bear cheetah
bearcheetah

NOTE 

the comma , adds a space in the first println
the plus sign concatenates the two strings
but adding spaces after the commas in or after the + sign does not change anything we need commas to get this done

INPUT FUNCTION--input function. 

Using this function, we can ask the user to give us strings that we can then use in our program. 
In order to get input from the user, we will have call the input function, 
then store the string that the user gives us into a variable
then we can use this variable elsewhere in the code (for example, print it out!).

input works similar to print in that it causes a result when we run the code, by hitting return
